# Conversion-between-D2887-SimDis-to-TBP-vol

## Conversion between D2887 weight % (SimDis) to TBP volumeric % based on API Technical Book 1997.

There are two ways how to calculate TBP vol%:
	1. Direct way (from D2887 wt% to TBP vol%);
	2. Firstly evaulated D86 vol% from D2887 wt% and then to TBP vol% from D86 vol%.

Input and output temperature is in [°C], but procedures operate with [F].

Notes:
	1. D2887 wt% to TBP vol%: D2887 50 wt% cutpoint is valid between 250 °F (121 °C) and 700 °F (371 °C);
	2. D2887 wt% to D86 vol%: D2887 50 wt% cutpoint is valid between 150 °F (65 °C) and 600 °F (315 °C);
	3. D86 vol% to TBP vol%: D86 50 vol% cutpoint is valid up to 480 °F (248 °C), however extrapolation can be carried up to 600 °F (315 °C).
